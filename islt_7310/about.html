    <h2>Getting to Know Your New Money Mentor</h2>
    
    <p>Hello there! I'm not your typical money guru, but with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration and an Associate of Applied Science in Accounting, <em>foundation</em> to the world of personal finance. Now, I’m on track to complete the Master of Business Administration program at the University of Missouri in July 2024.</p>

    <p><em>I love history</em> and delving into the past. My natural curiosity allows me to use the past to interpret the present and I’m always mindful of how the present will look when it becomes the past. I enjoy researching family traditions and learning how life was for the people who came before me. Some traditions are beautiful and I love to see them carry on, while some are harmful that should be left in the past. We must break generational curses that are harmful and do not serve our goals. One of the most impactful ways to do this is by increasing financial <strong>literacy</strong> in your family or community. My passion is to help anyone who is “bad” with money learn how to manage their time and resources more effectively.</p>
