<a href="resume.pdf">My Resume</a>    

    <p>Hello there! I'm not your typical money guru, but with a Bachelor of Science in Business 
        Administration and an Associate of Applied Science in Accounting, <em>foundation</em> to 
        the world of personal finance. Now, I am on track to complete the Master of Business 
        Administration program at the University of Missouri in July 2024.</p>

    <p>I love history and delving into the past. My natural curiosity allows 
        me to use the past to interpret the present and I am <em>always</em> mindful of how the present
         will look when it becomes the past. I enjoy researching family traditions and learning 
         how life was for the people who came before me. Some traditions are beautiful and I love
          to see them carry on. Others are harmful, and should be left in the past. We must 
          break generational curses that are harmful and do not serve our goals. One of 
          the most impactful ways to do this is by increasing <strong>financial literacy</strong> 
          in your family or community. My passion is to help anyone who is “bad” with money learn
           how to manage their time and resources more effectively.</p>
