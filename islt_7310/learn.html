    <p>CASH FLOW MANAGEMENT <br><br>
<p>Cash management is a fancy way of saying that you need to know how much money you make (inflow) and how much you spend (outflow). Everyone should bring in more money than they spend each month – this is the most fundamental step to leveling up financially. </p>
<p> You can use cash flow management to take control of your financial life (Mahoney). First, you must be aware of your inflows and outflows. It helps to make a list. You can simply find a piece of paper and a pen or use an online worksheet like this one from Consumer.gov. You can be as general or detailed as you want. There are no rules, this is for you!</p>
                    
<p>Cash Flow Management Principles:
Income
Earned income: employment paychecks are the main source of income for most of us.
Other: the check grandma sends you each month, child support, food stamp benefits, and any other money you expect to receive each month should also be included in this section. 
    Earned income + Other income = Total income</p>


    <strong><p>Expenses</p></strong>
        <ol>
             <li><p>Mandatory: Some expenses like rent, food, and basic utilities are required. These are things that you legitimately need, or deem 100% necessary.</p></li>
            <li><p>We have to make sure we have enough money to cover the mandatory expenses first, so be sure to include everything you can’t live without.</p></li> 
            <li><p>Total income - Mandatory expense = Money available for discretionary expenses.</p></li>
            <li><p>Discretionary: All other expenses are optional, or things that you want. Optional expenses typically deal with lifestyle choices. Haircuts, netflix, and concert tickets are good examples.</p></li>
            <li><p>Mandatory exp + Discretionary exp = Total expense</p></li>
        </ol>



                    <strong><p>Net Cash Flow:</p></strong>
<ol>
<li><p>Total income - Total expense = Net Cash Flow (+/-)</p>
<li><p>Net cash flow is the free money you have left over to save, invest, or do whatever you want with.</p>
<li><p>Positive (+): if your net cash flow is positive, you are successfully living within your means.</p> 
Celebrate because this is an important accomplishment!
Take a look at your discretionary expenses to decide if anything can be cut out or reduced and then make a plan to start saving.
<li><p>Negative (-): if your net cash flow is negative, you have two options. <br></p>
<li><p>Bring in more money. Consider asking for a raise, continuing your education, learning a specialized trade, or taking on a side hustle to increase your income.</p></li>
<li><p>Spend less money. Start with your discretionary expenses and see what can be removed or reduced. </p></li>
<br>
<li><em><p>Note: be careful if you have a positive net cash flow, but your income is just slightly higher than your expenses. Consider following the negative cash flow advice to improve your position.</p></em></li>
</ol>

    <p>SAVE <br><br>

<p>Saving is an important part of increasing your financial literacy. Saving money helps us reach our financial goals, like establishing an emergency fund, covering major expenses such as back-to-school shopping or home repairs, and planning for a comfortable retirement. Standard personal finance guidelines encourage you to save 20%-30% of your income, but where I come from that is nearly impossible. I want you to know achieving that is difficult for many people – and that’s okay! You can still save without following impractical rules.</p>

<p> The amount you save does not matter, just start the habit now. Whether it is $10 per paycheck or $50 a month, choose an amount that works for you and put your plan into action. Encourage yourself to stick to saving by paying yourself first. That means treating your savings like any other other bill; something you must pay. If you wait until after you’ve paid all your other expenses it is less likely that you will follow through. Remember, even small amounts add up over time!</p>

<p> To start saving you should do whatever will be easiest for you to maintain with the least amount of effort. Two popular options are to open a savings account and start an automatic transfer from your checking account on your pay days, or putting cash into a piggy bank at home.</p>

    <p>NEW MONEY MINDSET <br><br>

<p>I want you to be aware of the scarcity mindset. It is important to understand the causes and common behaviors/mistakes that result from the scarcity mindset. “We can't help what happened in our past, but we can start working on it now. You have to be a little disciplined to go learn this stuff — and it’s not necessarily intuitive — but it's not hard stuff, just new.”</p>

     <p> People are not poor because they make bad decisions; people remain poor because poverty inhibits their ability to make good decisions (Gilbert). Our brains are hardwired to make sure our most basic needs are met before we start thinking about things like our purpose in life. When you’re in this mindset you are susceptible to things like dangerously high interest payday loans because you are focused on what you need now. You’re unable to look forward to the future to notice how much more money you’ll be paying back than you borrowed. I grew up in a low income household and I understand it seems impossible to climb out when you feel so low. Beware of this insidious mindset! If we fall into the trap of learned helplessness we start believing we are hopelessly stuck and we won’t care to make choices or take actions that will improve our financial situation.</p>
     
<p> Remember, One of the biggest things standing in our way of achieving financial success is our mindset (Russell). We have to believe in ourselves and keep hope alive even in times of frustration. Please reach out to Level Up Budgeting or a trusted role model for support. We want to give you the tools to ease your anxiety and reach your financial goals!
